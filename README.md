## About

This project provides dark and interactive UI experience to chat with Strangers. Apart from chat you can even share media files and can get creative with emojis. 
This is all good but what if I want to talk over voice call? Well I saw that coming, and good news is, this app will let you call people who are online at the moment. 
How did you liked the UI?
